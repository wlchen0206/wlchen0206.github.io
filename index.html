    Currently, my research interests broadly lie in human-AI interactions in the era of LLM.
    I am particularly interested in bridging the gap between data-/model- centric approaches and human-centric approaches [5][3] for LLMs.
    I also work on the metigating hallucination in text generation [4] and free-text rationales [2][1].
    Previously, I was also a language ambassador of
